# Python-Quizzes
I created these online Python quizzes as a fun way for my to check my learning progress and to test my skills.  Each quiz takes you through a series of questions. Some of them are multiple choice, some will ask me to type in an answer, and some will require you to write actual Python code. As i make my own way through each quiz, it keeps score of which questions  answered correctly
