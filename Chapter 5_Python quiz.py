1.Question 1
What is wrong with this Python loop:
n = 5
while n > 0 :
    print(n)
print('All done')

<A>     This loop will run forever
<B>      The print('All done') statement should be indented four spaces
<C>      There should be no colon on the while statement
<D>     while is not a Python reserved word



AnS: <A>  This loop will run forever






2.Question 2
What does the break statement do?

<A>      Exits the currently executing loop
<B>      Exits the program
<C>      Resets the iteration variable to its initial value
<D>      Jumps to the "top" of the loop and starts the next iteration



AnS:<A> Exits the currently executing loop







3.Question 3
What does the continue statement do?

<A>      Jumps to the "top" of the loop and starts the next iteration
<B>      Resets the iteration variable to its initial value
<C>      Exits the program
<D>      Exits the currently executing loop



AnS:  <A>   Jumps to the "top" of the loop and starts the next iteration





4.Question 4
What does the following Python program print out?
tot = 0 
for i in [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] :
    tot = tot + 1
print(tot)

<A>    10
<B>    5
<C>    0
<D>    15



AnS: <B>  5




5.Question 5

friends = ['Joseph', 'Glenn', 'Sally']
for friend in friends :
     print('Happy New Year:',  friend)
print('Done!')

<A>    friend
<B>    Sally
<C>    Glenn
<D>    Joseph



AnS: <A> friend





6.Question 6
What is a good description of the following bit of Python code?
friends = ['Joseph', 'Glenn', 'Sally']
for friend in friends :
     print('Happy New Year:',  friend)
print('Done!')

<A>     Count all of the elements in a list
<B>     Find the smallest item in a list
<C>     Sum all the elements of a list
<D>     Compute the average of the elements in a list



AnS:  <C>  Sum all the elements of a list




7.Question 7
What will the following code print out?
smallest_so_far = -1
for the_num in [9, 41, 12, 3, 74, 15] :
   if the_num < smallest_so_far :
      smallest_so_far = the_num
print(smallest_so_far)
Hint: This is a trick question and most would say this code has a bug - so read carefully

<A>   -1
<B>   74
<C>   42
<D>    3


AnS: <A> -1




8.Question 8
What is a good statement to describe the is operator as used in the following if statement:
if smallest is None :
     smallest = value

<A>     The if statement is a syntax error
<B>     Looks up 'None' in the smallest variable if it is a string
<C>      Is true if the smallest variable has a value of -1
<D>     matches both type and value


AnS: <B>   not Looks up 'None' in the smallest variable if it is a string orifThe if statement is a syntax error







9.Question 9
Which reserved word indicates the start of an "indefinite" loop in Python?

<A>    break
<B>    def
<C>    for
<D>    while
<E>    indef


AnS: <D> while 




10.Question 10
How many times will the body of the following loop be executed?
n = 0
while n > 0 :
    print('Lather')
    print('Rinse')
print('Dry off!')

<A>    This is an infinite loop
<B>     5
<C>     0
<D>     1

AnS: <A>  this is an indefinite loop
